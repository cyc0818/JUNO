# How to Contribute to OUM

The OUM is generated by Sphinx with the markdown extension. In order to contribute the OUM, you need the basic knowledge about Markdown. 

## Checkout the source code

```bash
$ git clone git@code.ihep.ac.cn:JUNO/offline/junosw.git
```

## Install the Sphinx and related tools via pip

If you already setup the JUNO offline environment, you will have Python 3 and pip installed. Then we need to install the related tools to build OUM.

```bash
$ cd junosw/Doc/oum
$ pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

Please check the output and make sure the tools are installed without any problems. 
Here, the option `--user` will tell pip to install the tools under `$HOME/.local/bin`. So you also need to add this path into `$PATH`:

```bash
$ export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
$ which sphinx-build
~/.local/bin/sphinx-build
```

## Build the document

Just use `make html` to build the OUM:

```bash
$ make html
```

Please check whether the html files are generated at the build directory.

## Serve the document for testing

You can use `http.server` module from Python 3 to serve the generated OUM:

```bash
$ python -m http.server 8888 --bind 0.0.0.0 --directory build/html
```

Then, you can use your web browser to access http://localhost:8888 .
