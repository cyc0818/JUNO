# Voxel Method 

## Data Preparation

### Basic workflow
* Produce full simulation dataset using Geant4 -> EDM data
  * Photons with 1MeV Visible Energy 
* Generate ntuples based on the EDM data -> ntuples, geom-relation.root (optional)
  * Use script relation_finder.py
* Generate NPE and hit time distribution respectively
  * time distribution
    * Use script timedispatch.C to generate the histograms of hit time distribution.
  * nPE
    * Use script npedispatch.C to generate the histograms of nPE distribution.
* Merge the histograms and put the TAxis objects into the hisograms.
  * time
    * Use script saveAxisTime.C
  * nPE
    * Use script saveAxisNPE.C
* Finally, after merge, there are three files:
  * Gemetry file
  * nPE distributin file
  * hit time distributin file
